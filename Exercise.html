				<p>Hi, this is my new blog. Hopefully in the future I will be able to put in amazing things here, but for now, I'll keep it as simple as possible. My name is <strong>Tim</strong> and I have an amazing life. I'm from <em>Indonesia</em>. A family of 5, two brothers, awesome parents, and just great friends. I have a girlfriend who is a blogger so hopefully this skills would allow me to make her blog much better than it already is. I can keep on going but I will stop now just so I won't crowd the space provided in the site.</p>
